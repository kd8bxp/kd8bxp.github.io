# Chatter Bot

## Installation

Simple fun chatter bot.   
1) Head from a Wowwee Tri-bot  
2) Catalex Uart MP3 player   
3) Arduino UNO or the like  
4) amplified speaker for the MP3 player  

From the Tri-Bot Head, purple wire is connected to 3.3v
using a ground wire I tested the other wires to figure out which does what.
I am only using the center mouth led, and the 2 eye leds in this project.
There are also 2 ear leds, a white led (headlamp), and 2 more mouth leds.
There is a motor that will pop the headlamp and ears out.
This motor will also bring them all back into the head. 

You need to find some jokes or some random stuff for your chat bot to just
mindless say.  For mine I found some Star Wars jokes. Used a Text to Speech program, I made
a WAV file, and converted that file to a MP3. 
The MP3 player will play the 1st "song" it finds and stops. The mouth leds are not
any way synchronized to the sound, it just flashes the mouth.

## Things To Do

add other mouth LEDs.
make it play more than one MP3 file or repeat the MP3 over and over again.
