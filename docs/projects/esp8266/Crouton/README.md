# Demo of Crouton

This is a demo for use with Crouton.mybluemix.net IOT dashboard.  
Minimum hardware - D1 Mini (ESP8266) and D1 Mini Relay shield.  
The D1 Mini creates a push button dash board on Crouton, which is used to turn the  
relay on and off.  A D1 Mini Pushbutton shield can also be used for local control  
of the relay.
