Outline Script for Star Wars Day, Hero Junior.

10 minute target.

One of the Hero Videos on Youtube had a “checkout” video. It was just
simple one step checks, but it struck me as interesting as it reminded
me of stuff you would hear going on while you were in space. A bunch of
boring equipment checkout sequences. Might appeal to kids or set
background. I was thinking that doing this in the dead time before the
demo might be entertaining.

but similar)

Timing will be a major issue with this demo, so hopefully we can pull it
off.
