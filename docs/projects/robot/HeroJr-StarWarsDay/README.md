# Hero Jr Special Star Wars Day Code



## Installation

This is of my Hero Jr project - (only with a special code) - I bought a Nonworking Hero Jr some time ago, after many years, I finally decided what to do with it.
I replaced all of the boards with modern hardware.  An Arduino Mega 2560 became the brains, a SR04 ultrasonic replaced the Polaroid ultrasonic, L298 Motor Drivers were used, and a eMic 2
speech synthesizer for his voice.  Some other modern hardware was used as well. I keep the 12v stepper, and DC motor.  The main goal of the project was to keep it looking as original as posssible. 
And I I've managed to do just that.  This December (2015) our local library is having a Star Wars day, and I was asked to bring it. So this is a special sketch just for that day.
A MP3 player will be added for additional Star Wars sound effects.  This is very early stage of the "Special Star Wars Day Code"
