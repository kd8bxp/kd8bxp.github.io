# Documenting Arduino Projects {#arduino-projects}

Came across this site a few days ago, it builds websites from &quot;Mark Down&quot; text.

The sites can then be uploaded to github and make good documentation.

[http://www.mkdocs.org/](http://www.mkdocs.org/#adding-pages)

Here is just a &#039;demo/test&#039; site I made in about 3 mins and pushed to github.

[http://kd8bxp.github.io/Arduino-Projects/](http://kd8bxp.github.io/Arduino-Projects/)

(I am in the process of updating this with all of the projects here)

Making the &quot;mark down&quot; text is easy, and the mkdoc app makes it look nice!

Mkdocs - &quot;Mark Down&quot; -

[http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/)

Make Docs is a fast, simple static site generator, that’s geared towards building project documentation.

Written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Easy to use, and fast to generate a professional looking site with documents.

Projects hosted on github, “come with” pages - and the files generated by Mkdocs can be used as these pages.

Mkdocs even makes it easy to push (while it’s creating) the documents to github.

If you don’t want to use Github to host your documents - that’s ok too, the site generated is static, and should work on anything that can host a site (I didn’t have much luck getting to work with google sites thou)

This site directly supports documents from github and others:

Git hub has a 3 min (read) tutorial on using “Github Markdown”

[https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

and mkdocs has some additional things specifically for it:

[http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/)

As I said once before there is also something called: Gitbook

which can generate books from various types of files, Markdown is one.

There are a couple (more than a couple) online Word (and others) coverters that will convert a file to markdown. Mkdocs can use those files to build a website.

Here are a couple I tried:

WIKIs are another alternative for Documentation projects:

Here are a few that have free accounts, I’ve not tried any of them.

Google Sites also has a couple of templates that are good for documenting.

Here are a couple of DEMO sites I made - and to make changes to them is easy in the online editor:

[https://sites.google.com/site/demokd8bxp/](https://sites.google.com/site/demokd8bxp/) (good basic site)

[https://sites.google.com/site/kd8bxpwiki/](https://sites.google.com/site/kd8bxpwiki/) (Much like a wiki, and easy to add, change and update)
