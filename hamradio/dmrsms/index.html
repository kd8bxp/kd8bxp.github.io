<p>SMS via Radio or Hotspot
May 15, 2020Ben
One of the most underutilised by very cool feature that comes with some digital networks is the ability to send and receive SMS messages. You can send it fairly easily to another radio, but did you know you can also receive a weather report, see where your last GPS transmitted location is, and send messages to your mobile phone. The best thing is there no cost either.</p>
<p>While not all networks and not all radio’s support sending SMS’s. Some hotspots do and some done also just to make it even more confusing. While I don’t plan to list all networks available, as they there are more all the time, and the settings change also. However, at the time of writing this (2020), the VK-DMR network does not support GPS or SMS (you must turn it off to use the system), but the BrandMeister one does. So, I will talk from here on about the BrandMeister network. If you use a different network, then check with that network first.</p>
<p>BrandMeister Setup
First you need to setup your BrandMeister account to send and receive SMS. From the BrandMeister page, login at the right of the screen. Then under Services on the left side, select selfcare. I usually set the radio brand to either ETSI or Motorola, however this will depend on the radio you have. While you are here, you might want to turn on or off your GPS location and check everything looks good.</p>
<p>Radio Setup
Would you believe most digital radios allow you to send and receive messages right from the screen easily. However not all. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this (2020), the OpenGD-77 does not support text messaging as yet. However, it is on the job list. I do understand that since text messaging isn’t the most used option in digital radio, probably leaving this setup until last is fair enough. However, I have done it on the original GD-77 firmware, and seen it done on other radio’s also.</p>
<p>If your fortunate enough, you may have a hotspot that can do it anyway.</p>
<p>Hotspot Sending
I am not going to talk about every hotspot available, mainly because I don’t own every hotspot available. But I will talk about the OpenSpot as I have a couple of them myself, and I know they work.</p>
<p>From a PC, the menu on the right side has DMR SMS chat that will bring up a box much like the picture below.</p>
<p>DMR SMS Chat in OpenSpot
262993 GPS and Weather
If you send the message help to destination ID 262993 you will get a prompt much like above. It may take a little while to reply. As I live in Melbourne, you can see above I then sent a private message to 262993 again and typed in the message wx Melbourne, AU. You can see above the message on the left I received. Remember, the reply’s do take a while to come back and usually arrive just as you have given up waiting!</p>
<p>You could also send the message gps help to the same number, 262993, to get an overview of all the GPS commands which includes setting your home position, and so on. If you have transmitted your GPS location with the same callsign you set up in the selfcare then it will reply with your last location sent. If you want to save that as your home location, send GPS SET and it will save your last location as your home location. Then you will get from now on your home location and your last transmitted location.</p>
<p>If you send RSSI to 262993 it will reply with the repeater and connected talk group you were last using. If you send a message INFO <em>callsign where </em>callsign is replaced with your call sign you will get a reply when you last spoke. If you have two digital ID numbers, then it will send both of them back to you.</p>
<p>262994 Repeater, POCSAG and dapnet
If you send RPT SMS to 262994 you will get a reply of what static talk groups you are currently connected to.</p>
<p>You can also send a message to a call sign using this 262994 number. For example, if you want to send a message to me, send VK3TBS followed by your message to number 262994. However, I couldn’t get this to work – maybe because I was messaging myself! If you get it to work, please let me know what I did wrong.</p>
<p>262995 SMSC – SMS-ing to a mobile phone
This is taking SMS-ing to the next level. I was even able to SMS my wife who doesn’t have a licence.</p>
<p>To do this, send the following message SMSGTE @[phone number] [message] to 262995. where [phone number] is your country number (e.g. 61 for Australia) followed by the mobile number. Remember to remove the first 0 if you’re in Australia.</p>
<p>There is more information on sending messages to and from your radio to mobile phones on the smsgte.org web site. There is heaps of information under the User Guide menu.</p>
<p>UPDATE – Before I finish, I discovered the hard way that when you send a message from a mobile phone to a radio, I got a bill. I am not sure if it was because I am in Australia, or my phone carrier saw the oppertunity, but I think with a few tests it was only $1 or so.</p>
<p>APRS Chat
APRS is almost a bit easier and can quickly send messages to and from a mobile phone. Once you have done the above setup, I selected APRS chat in my OpenSpot2 dashboard. Then I sent a message with the destination callsign of SMSGTE then the message was @[phone number] [message] there [phone number] is your country number (e.g. 61 for Australia) followed by the mobile number. Remember to remove the first 0 if you’re in Australia.</p>
<p>You can see in the picture below I sent a message Test from hotspot to my phone which appeared instantly. I then sent one back from my phone saying This is from my mobile phone which then appeared instantly. It worked really well.</p>

BrandMeister Service Numbers</p>
<p>BM262 Service Numbers
The BrandMeister Germany team has implemented some nice features.
They coded some 'SMS servicenumbers', these are services you can address via BM SMS.</p>
<p>Their documentation can be found in the BM262 BrandMeister Wiki</p>
<p>I made an English translation of te SMSC service number.</p>
<p>262995 - SMSC
English translation by ON7LDS</p>
<p>Preface
set the correct Brand for your transceiver in your BrandMeister SelfCare
all commands should be sent as a private call to the 262995
the commands are case-insensitive
there should be only one space between query parts
information in <brackets> are placeholders for parameters, '&lt;' and '&gt;' should not be sent
some Chinese devices (eg Anytone or RT3) unfortunately can not receive long text messages and may show only parts of the message or ignore the message completely.
AnyTone has also problems with the reception of SMS while the hang time after sending an SMS is still active. For this and for short SMSses, it is possible to activate a "Special Configuration" (see point 10)</p>
<ol>
<li>ECHO - Function test
Format : ECHO
Example: ECHO</li>
</ol>
<p>The ECHO command can be used to test whether the SMS send / receive works correctly.
When a text message comes back, everything is OK.
If no SMS is coming back, there is no need to test the other functions (except for the "Special Configuration") , since these will most likely not work :-(</p>
<p>The answer may look like this:</p>
<p>Hi Jens,
SMS which received by the system.</p>
<p>When you do not receive any answer and you did set the correct Brand for your transceiver in your BrandMeister SelfCare, please follow the instructions described in section 10 "Special Configuration".</p>
<ol>
<li>Write SMS
Format: <CALLSIGN> <message>
Example: DK5RAS This is a test
To send an SMS to someone, start with the callsign, followed by a space and then the desired message.</li>
</ol>
<p>As some transceivers (eg AnyTone or RT3) have problems with longer text messages, you should make sure that the message is not too long.</p>
<p>Mostly, SMSses containing more than 256 characters will be truncated to 256 characters. Furthermore, you can optionally enable the reduction to 127 characters (more information at section 10 at the end of this manual).</p>
<p>The receiver will be notified, next to your call, of the sending time of the SMS. These characters have to be deducted from the actual message !</p>
<p>When the recipient retrieves the SMS on the same day it was sent to him/her, the date will be suppressed.</p>
<p>DO1JG (23:06)
This is a test</p>
<p>If the SMS is retrieved the next day or later, the SMS also contains the date (and thus making it longer).</p>
<p>Retrieved the same year :</p>
<p>DO1JG (30.08 -. 17:50)
This is a test</p>
<p>Retrieved another year :</p>
<p>DO1JG (08/30/2018 - 17:50)
This is a test</p>
<p>This means that the header in can be 24 or 28 characters (line break are 2 characters), and in the case of a 6-digit callsign: 25 or 29 characters.</p>
<p>For example, since the AnyTone can receive only 127 characters, you should limit the actual message to 98 characters.</p>
<p>After having sent your SMS, you get a confirmation from the system that the message has been stored in the system.</p>
<p>Your SMS to DO1JG has been stored in the system</p>
<p>When you do not want the confirmation, you can disable it:</p>
<p>Format: SEND <ON | OFF>
Disable: SEND OFF
Enable: SEND ON</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive SMS
There are several possibilities:</li>
</ol>
<p>automatic delivery
notification that an SMS has been received
manual retrieval</p>
<p>2.0 Requirements
For the notification and for automatic delivery, the radio ARS (Motorola) or RRS (Hytera) must have been enabled or the GPS position has to be sent regularly.
When the transceiver communicates with the BrandMeister system (via ID xxx999 (eg 262999)), it is checked if there are new SMSses available.</p>
<p>When using the automatic delivery, however, there is also the possibility that SMSses are lost. This can be when the time slot is blocked by other traffic short after communicating with the SMSC or when the reception is interrupted or bad.
When further automatic delivery or notification does not take place, the SMSses, however, are not lost and can still be accessed manually.</p>
<p>2.1 SMS Notification
By default, the "SMS Notification" option is enabled. This will send, by SMS, the number of messages in the INBOX (Conditions see 2.0)</p>
<p>You have 5 new SMS in your INBOX.
Send INBOX to 262995 to get a list or send GET to receive all SMS.</p>
<p>The number of new SMSses in this notification relates to SMSses for which you do not yet have been informed. When another SMS arrives at this point, the next notification would only give notice about 1 SMS.
The advantage of this system is that one can make free space for SMSses in the radio first, before retrieving them. Also, there will be no sudden reception of many unexpected messages.</p>
<p>2.2 Automatic Delivery:
The automatic notification is disabled by default, but can be enabled/disabled using the following command:</p>
<p>Format: DIRECT <ON | OFF>
Enable: DIRECT ON
Disable: DIRECT OFF
Once this feature is enabled, you get (under the conditions of 2.0) the SMS sent immediately to your device. The message is not deleted by the system after delivery and can thus later once again be retrieved.
The advantage of this system is obvious: you do not have to send commands to retrieve the SMSses. The downside is that you can get an unexpected number of SMSses at once and at least the AnyTone has issues with this (not receiving all SMSses or reboots).</p>
<p>Everyone must decide which system suits him or her the best. When you use Hytera or Motorola devices and you are not expecting a lot of SMSses, it makes sense to activate automatic delivery.
Nevertheless, one should query its INBOX regularly (see below) because SMSses can be lost sometimes.</p>
<p>2.3 Manual retrieval
No matter which option you have chosen, you can always retrieve the SMSses manually.</p>
<p>Format: INBOX
Example: INBOX
With the command INBOX (or short IN) you get a list of SMSses, stored in your inbox.
It is a numbered list, with the most recent SMS first.</p>
<p>A possible answer may look like this:</p>
<p>You have 9 SMS in your INBOX
1. DO1JG (23:06)
2. DO1JG (22:27)
3. DO1JG (22:21)
4. DO1JG (08/30/2018 - 17:50 )
5. DO1JG (08/30/2018 - 17:46)
6. DO1JG (08/30/2018 - 13:59)
7. DO1JG (08/30/2018 - 05:12)
8. DO1JG (08/30/2018 - 03:42)
9 . DO1JG (08/30/2018 - 03:41)</p>
<p>This answer would be 268 characters long and would not be displayed correctly on 'problematic' devices. Even Motorola and Hytera devices would not show the complete message.
For this reason, SMSses which are longer than 256 characters are generally shortened to 256 characters. Optionally you can, as already mentioned above, activate the reduction to 127 characters.
It is advised to regularly erase your SMSses from the INBOX (see below).</p>
<p>2.3.1 Retrieveof all SMSses in one go
Format: ALL
Example: ALL
With the command ALL (or alternatively GET) you instruct the system to send all SMSses to your device.
Note that, as mentioned above, not all devices may possibly handle a high number of SMSses at once.
The messages are not deleted from the system by this command and can be queried again if, for example, some text messages were not received.</p>
<p>2.3.2 query a specific SMS
Format: GET <NUMBER>
Example: GET 4
With the GET command (or alternatively READ) one can retrieve a specific SMS.
<NUMBER> is the number of the SMS as shown with the INBOX command.
It should be noted that the number is not fixed to the SMS, but always the actual index in the INBOX. So if you delete a message in the middle of the list, the following SMSses will shift to the top and thus will be renumbered.</p>
<p>This feature is interesting for devices which can not process all SMSses at once.
In this case, with GET 1 one can always retrieve the most recent SMS.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete SMS
There are two possibilities: delete all SMS in the INBOX at once or delete a specific SMS.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.1 Delete all SMSses
Format: DELETE
Example: DELETE
With the command DELETE (or alternatively DEL) you can delete all SMSses in the INBOX at once.
It makes sense once you have accessed the SMSses, to use this command to keep the INBOX clean.</p>
<p>answer:</p>
<p>All SMS to you has been deleted.</p>
<p>3.2. Delete a specific SMS
Format: DELETE <NUMBER>
Example: DELETE 4
With the DELETE <NUMBER> command (or alternatively DEL <NUMBER>) you can delete specific SMS.
<NUMBER> is the number of the SMS as shown with the INBOX command.
It should be noted that the number is not fixed to the SMS, but always the actual index in the INBOX. So if you delete a message in the middle of the list, the following SMSses will shift to the top and thus will be renumbered.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>SMS has been deleted.</p>
<ol>
<li>"Special configuration"
Note:
The "Special Configuration" is also valid for the service number 262993.
so the "Special Configuration" commands can also be sent to 262993.</li>
</ol>
<p>10.1 query the current configuration
Format: CONFIG
Example: CONFIG
If one sends the command CONFIG, the current "Special Configuration" will be sent to the device by SMS.
When you do not get a SMS as a response, it is an indication you have to activate the "Special Configuration".</p>
<p>10.2 Enable or disable "Special Configuration"
Format: CONFIG <ON | OFF>
Enable: CONFIG ON
Disable: CONFIG OFF
You can enable or disable the "Special Configuration" as needed, depending on the device used.
Note : The settings will only be considered if the configuration is enabled.</p>
<p>10.3 SMS length for reception
Format: CONFIG <SHORT | LONG>
To cut received SMSses to 127 characters: CONFIG SHORT
To cut received SMSses to 256 characters: CONFIG LONG
AnyTone or RT3 users are strongly advised to activate the SHORT option, and of course also the "Special Configuration".</p>
<p>10.4 transmitting / receiving delay
Format: CONFIG DELAY &lt;1-10&gt;
delay for 8 seconds: CONFIG DELAY 8
The transmission / reception delay (an integer number, minimum 1 second and maximum of 10 seconds) is the time that elapses before the system will answer upon receiving an SMS command.
The default is 2.5 seconds.</p>
<p>The Anytone has an bug where no SMSses will be received during the hang time after sending an SMS.
Values of 7...10 have been proved to solve this.</p>
<p>10.5 Reset Configuration
Format: CONFIG RESET
Example: CONFIG RESET
The CONFIG RESET command will reset the "Special Configuration" back to the system default.
In the meantime, the "Special Configuration" is also disabled.</p>
